    <h2 id="workNeed">Why Women Need to Work?</h2>
    <p>The question, in the modern-day world, is no longer whether a woman should work; it is one of
        economic necessity, one of gender equality, and one of social betterment. Comprising almost half of
        the human population, participation of women in the workforce is not just a crucial but also a
        salubrious activity for one and all.</p>
    <h3>Economic Independence and Security:</h3>
    <p> Womenshould workbasically because of economic independence. A woman shouldn't just sit back
        and wait for the male partner to provide while facing the risks associated with an economic downturn
        or inflation. By working, women chip into their household income, therefore ensuring their families
        are better hedged against financial instability. This independence also gives women a chance to make
        decisions about their lives and future without being constrained by financial dependency.</p> 
    <h3>Maximising Potential and Education:</h3> 
        <p> Women's education is something that cannot and should not go to waste. So many women acquire
            degrees and train themselves for years only to be told that they are better off not working. If this
            talent is not put into action, it is not only a personal loss that will be incurred but also societal.
            Working women contribute their education and talents toward innovation, productivity, and
            therefore the general economy. They also serve as role models to young girls in helping them pursue
            their dreams and careers.</p>  
    <h3> Contributing to Economic Growth:</h3>
    <p> Women's participation in the workforce significantly raises economic growth. With more women
        working, there is a wider talent pool from which industries draw, bringing greater innovation and
        efficiency to the workplace. Indeed, according to studies, very often gender-diverse teams perform
        better because they bring across-the-board perspectives and ideas that help in decision-making.
        Working is not just helping women; working women are actually driving progress and prosperity for
        their communities and countries.</p>
    <h3>Equality and Empowerment:</h3>
    <p> It is also a means of promoting gender equality. For too long, social norms have confined women to
        only the domestic sphere and devalued their potential in the working sphere. The right to work for
        womendebunksthese age-old chauvinistic and oppressing norms and charts the course toward a
        society more leveled in terms of the genders. Work helps women find purpose, achievement, and
        empowerment by contributingfully to society and therefore helps break out of traditional gender
        roles.</p>
    <h3>Coping with Modern Realities:</h3>
    <p>It is very difficult for a single-income family to meet all the financial requirements increased by the
        cost of living in the modern worldâ€”expenses that seem to grow with every rising of the sun. Two
       income families are much better placed to meet the financial requirements that have risen in housing,
        education, and health sectors. Women's work is no longer an option; it is a practical necessity in
        today's economy. Furthermore, with the growth of flexible work arrangements, telecommuting, and
        entrepreneurship, the opportunity for today's woman to balance her work and family life has been
        opened more than it was before.</p>

    <p>From Homemaker to Tech Innovator: An Inspiring Story
        Meet Ayesha, a lady from some small town in Pakistan who has spent the first decade of her adult life running a house. Educated in computer science, she was swayed by societal expectations to focus solely on the running of her household and the rearing of children. With her children growing older, though, the urge to again connect with her passion for technology set in.
        <br>
        Though her friends and family raised their eyebrows over this, she started taking online courses to upgrade her skills. She managed everything at home but stayed up late every night to study. It wasn't easy, but Ayesha was bent upon tapping that education and talent she had foregone all these years.
        <br>
        Within months, the hard work paid off, and Ayesha landed an internship at a Lahore-based tech startup. Soon, her persistence and creative ways of thinking made her outstanding. A year later, Ayesha was working on and leading a team for the development of an application that provided rural women with access to important health information in Pakistan. The app got wide recognition and won an award for social impact.
        <br>
        The journey of Ayesha from homemaker to tech innovator tells a lot about the amount of patience and persistence women contribute to the workforce. She lived her dream and also created a tool that would positively impact the lives of countless women in her community.
        <br>
        Her story testifies to the fact that it's never too late in one's life to engage in what one really likes, and more importantly women, irrespective of their condition or situation, have immense potential for change and making a difference.</p>

        womenindependence, fulfills their potential, fuels economic growth, and advances gender equality.
